In a QTL scan of the X chromosome, special covariates (such as sex) may need to be included under the null hypothesis of no QTL, to avoid spurious evidence of linkage. (See [Broman et al. (2006) Genetics 174:2151-2158](http://www.genetics.org/content/174/4/2151.long).)

The particular X chromosome covariates depends on the cross, and can be obtained with the [qtl2geno](https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2geno)
function `get_x_covar()`.

```{r x_covar, eval=FALSE}
Xcovar <- get_x_covar(iron)
```
